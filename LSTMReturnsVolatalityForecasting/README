Primarily, a linear regression model is trained to obtain baseline predictions of the realized
volatility over a 30-day horizon for the AAPL, MSFT and GOOGL stock indices. A
successor to the LR model â€“ a Support Vector Regression model is tuned and fitted on the
data to obtain better forecasts. Moving from traditional regression techniques to neural
networks, a three-layer TensorFlow-based feed forward network is fitted on the training data
which seems to yield significant forecasts. A further enhancement to this network is done by
adding a LSTM layer which predicts the most accurate forecasts of realized volatility so far
on the test set with appropriate hyperparameter tuning. This best model is then used to
forecast 30-day ahead realized volatility with appropriate dataset and model parameters
changes.
